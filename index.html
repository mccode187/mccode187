      hi, my name is michael. recently, i've been exploring some questions about finite additive 2-bases. yay much fun! :) <br>
      below are some results that i thought of.
      i'm not sure if they are interesting or if they are already known, but i decided to share them because i thought they were cool.
      enjoy! :)
