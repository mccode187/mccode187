    <p>Hi, my name is Michael.</p>
    <p>Recently, I've been exploring some questions about finite additive 2-bases. </p>
    <p>Below is a running list of the results that I've come up with so far. </p>
    <p>I plan to add to it whenever I come up with a new result.</p>
    <p>My knowledge of the literature is limited, but to the best of my knowledge, the results below are novel.</p>
    <p>Enjoy! :) </p>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, or want to collaborate, 
      feel free to email me at michael02chu@gmail.com </p>
