    <p>Hi, my name is michael.</p>
    <p>Recently, i've been exploring some questions about finite additive 2-bases. </p>
    <p>Below are some results that i thought of. </p>
    <p>I'm not sure if they are interesting or if they are already known, 
      but i decided to post them here anyways. </p>
    <p>enjoy! :) </p>
    <p>If you are interested in these results or finite additive 2-bases in general, 
      or have any questions or ideas, or want to collaborate, 
      feel free to email me at michael02chu@gmail.com </p>
    <p>\(|\{S \subseteq [0,n] : 2S \not \ni n\}| = 3^{\lfloor (n+1)/2 \rfloor}\) &emsp;
