    <p>Hi, my name is Michael. Recently, I've been exploring some questions about finite additive 2-bases. </p>
    <p>Below is a running list of the results that I've come up with so far. I plan to add to it whenever I come up with a new result.</p>
    <p>My knowledge of the literature is limited, but to the best of my knowledge, the results below are novel.</p>
    <p>Enjoy! :) </p>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, or want to collaborate, 
      please feel free to contact me by sending an email to <a href = "mailto: michael02chu@gmail.com">michael02chu@gmail.com</a>. <br> </p>
