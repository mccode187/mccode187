    <p>hi, my name is michael.</p>
    <p>recently, i've been exploring some questions about finite additive 2-bases.</p>
    <p>below are some results that i thought of.</p>
    <p>i'm not sure if they are interesting or if they are already known, but i decided to post them here because i thought they were cool.</p>
    <p>enjoy! :) </p>
    <p>if you are interested in these things, or have any questions or ideas, or want to collaborate, feel free to email me at michael02chu@gmail.com </p>
    <p>\(|\{S \subseteq [0,n] : 2S \not \ni n\}| = 3^{\lfloor (n+1)/2 \rfloor}\) &emsp;
