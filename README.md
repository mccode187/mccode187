welcome, everyone! this is my personal website; i hope you enjoy it! :)

on the website, you will find links to the things i have created online.

you can also access the website by going to 
[michaelcchu.github.io](https://michaelcchu.github.io/). 
this link simply redirects to [mcchu.com](https://mcchu.com/).

previously, my website was at 
[mccode187.github.io](https://mccode187.github.io/), 
but this address no longer works / i am no longer using it.

thanks for visiting!
